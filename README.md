# TextSummarizerUsingPageRank
Page Rank Algorithm 's from scratch implemntation.

WORK FLOW
1)Implementation using page rank algorithm.
   Did all preprocessing steps before this including punctuation removal, stopwords, and lemmatization.
Then implemented Page rank algorithm.
Output: Bunch of jumbled keywords.
2)Page rank algo
But no stopword removal and lemmatization and all punctuation except full stops so tokenization is a list of lists of sentences based on full stops. Output was meaningful text but did not capture the essence of the text as only a summary of only top part text was being returned.
Also gave an error for multiple texts having only stopwords summary could not be generated for those.
3)Implemented pegasus-google text summarization algorithm briefly
4)Used on Topic modelling using lda.To extract meaninful topics and then to search for the sentences with those words and add them to my summary.
Meaningful.Does not capture essence completely.As in some keywords were there it would have drastically improved the summary.
Issue of empty summaries persisted.
